### Trello Intro Lecture Notes
For the rest of this week and part of the week we get back from break we will be working on a full stack application called Cat Tinder. For those of you who are not familiar with what Tinder is, it is a dating website, where we have converted it to a cat (or your choice of animal or object) "dating" website, where you can see a list of cats, view their information, create, update or delete a cat.

  It is a decoupled app, which means we are actually creating 2 applications and then connecting them. We will use React on frontend and a Rails API on the backend.  Then we'll connect them and learn how to fetch data and return the data to display. 

For the project you'll be in teams of two or three, the same group the whole week. We are going to start by introducing you to Trello for Project Management. Each group will have their own Trello board, so let's take some time now to navigate Trello, learn the process and our expectations of you.  You will also be using Trello for apartment app and capstone, so learning this process is very important.  Dev teams use a PM tool, so being familiar with Trello will help you in your internship and beyond. First, let's have everyone create their own account on Trello. Once you've created your board, please post the email address you used in the thread so we can invite you to your boards.

<< Bring up Trello Board >>

The Trello board is divided into columns, aka swim lanes, which describe the status of tasks.  Cards can cross lanes as particular tasks are completed.  Click on the card to open it and you'll see a description and a checklist of tasks. Good practice is to add the name of the person who has been assigned to a card, which means they are responsible for completing that card. For Cat Tinder we have built the board for you - each card is one section of the syllabus.

Each card has a dedicated branch name. Swim lanes: DOING - only move if you are acting on it now. MVP - is your todo list. Your team will have Trello board that is a copy of what you see here. It is very important that you do every task on the list (AND check off every task on the list!) before you move the card to PR Review.

Here is the process for PR review requests.  This is very important! We will be using this process throughout the rest of the cohort.

- Click on card for more information
  - Add team members onto card
  - Card is complete ONLY when you have completed the task on the card. 
  - Stick to what the card asks for, check boxes as you complete them
  - Each card has a branch name
  - Move to doing if you are working on task
  - Move to PR review once you have completed the task and you are waiting for review.
    - When requesting a review:
      - Submit PR
      - Post in slack: @Will, @TriciaSykes Please review my PR for ____ 
          PR: ---Link to PR---   
          Trello: ---Link to Trello Card---
      - When one of us is reviewing, we will place the ðŸ‘€ emoji.
      - When we approve the PR, we will place the âœ… emoji
      - Once you merge and delete the branch, you will add the github parrot emoji
      - If there are requested changes, we will leave a comment saying to take a look at our feedback in GitHub.

You do not need to make a PR after your initial commit.  Remember we are creating our main branch with that first commit. BUT you do need to drop the github url into the main channel and ping both of us, like this:

@TriciaSykes @Will please add branch portections to this repo
url here

Then move PR review on Trello.
For communication between the instruction team and your team, we will be using specific emojis.
One of the instructors will use the eyeballs emoji to signify we are looking at it, we're on it. 
We will use the checkmark emoji when it is approved.  
Once approved, you will need to add the github parrot emoji to say hey, ok, we have seen this and we can move on.
